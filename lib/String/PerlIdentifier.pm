=head1 NAME

String::PerlIdentifier - Generate a random name for a Perl variable

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to version 0.04, released November 25, 2005.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use String::PerlIdentifier;

    $varname = make_varname();      # defaults to 10 characters

or

    $varname = make_varname(12);    # min: 3    max: 20

or

    $varname = make_varname( {      # set your own attributes
        min     => $minimum,
        max     => $maximum,
        default => $default,
    } );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module automatically exports a single subroutine, C<make_varname()>, 
which returns a string composed of random characters that qualifies as 
the name for a Perl variable.  The characters are limited to upper- and
lower-case letters in the English alphabet, the numerals from 0 through 9
and the underscore character.  The first character may not be a numeral.

By default, C<make_varname()> returns a string of 10 characters, but if a
numerical argument between 3 and 20 is passed to it, a string of that length
will be returned.  Arguments smaller than 3 are rounded up to 3; arguments
greater than 20 are rounded down to 20.

C<make_varname()> can also take as an argument a reference to a hash
containing one or more of the following keys:

    min
    max
    default

So if you wanted your string to contain a minimum of 15 characters and a
maximum of 30, you would call:

    $varname = make_varname( { min => 15, max => 30 } );

If you try to set C<min> greater than C<max>, you will get an error message
and C<croak>.  But if you set C<default> less than C<min> or greater than
C<max>, the default value will be raised to the minimum or lowered to the
maximum as is appropriate.

B<Note:>  Although the strings returned by C<make_varname()> qualify as Perl
identifiers, they also are a subset of the set of valid directory and file
names on operating systems such as Unix and Windows.  This is how, for
instance, this module's author uses C<make_varname()>.

B<Note:>  String::PerlIdentifier originally appeared on CPAN as
String::MkVarName.  When I went to register it on F<modules@perl.org>, 
C<brian d foy> persuaded me to change the name.

=head1 TO DO

Ideally, you should be able to pass the function a list of strings 
forbidden to be returned by C<make_varname>, I<e.g.,> a list of all 
Perl variables currently in scope.  String::PerlIdentifier doesn't do that yet.

=item String::MkPasswd

This CPAN module by Chris Grau was the inspiration for String::PerlIdentifier.
String::PerlIdentifier evolved as a simplification of String::MkPasswd for 
use in the test suite for my other CPAN module File::Save::Home.

=item String::Random

This CPAN module by Steven Pritchard is a more general solution to the problem
of generating strings composed of random characters.  To generate a
10-character string that would qualify as a Perl identifier using
String::Random, you would proceed as follows:

    use String::Random;
    $rr = String::Random->new();
    $rr->{'E'} = [ 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '_' ];
    $rr->{'F'} = [ 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '_', 0..9 ];

then

    $rr->randpattern("EFFFFFFFFF");

String::Random's greater generality comes at the cost of more typing.

=item File::Save::Home

CPAN module by the same author as String::PerlIdentifier which uses
C<make_varname()> in its test suite as of its version 0.05.  
File::Save::Home is used internally within recent versions of 
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and its test suite.
